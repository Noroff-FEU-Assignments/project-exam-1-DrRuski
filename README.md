## Description
This blog post website was researched, designed and developed in a 5 week period at the end of my first year as a Frontend student @![Noroff](https://www.noroff.no/en/).
By incorporating all of my existing knowledge and skill, I came up with a somewhat commercialized blog posting website.
My thought process was that instead of making a personalized blog website, I rather wanted users who visit the site to make an account, get verified (as to not let any trolls in) and then be able to post their own opinions/game or movie reviews/potential news leaks, etc. In essence, I wanted a website made by a gamer for a gamer.
